# 🗂️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

# 🏗️ Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

![data_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6f35b7-3041-4ce2-9b51-45bd69b0a270)

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# 📖 Project Overview
